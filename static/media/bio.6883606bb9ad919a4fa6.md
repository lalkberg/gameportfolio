Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Leo Alkberg, and I'm a technical game designer. I'm 26 years old and I've worked in the game industry both as a programmer and game designer for the last four years. 

My speciality is technical design but I have professional experience in a lot of different aspects of game design. These include level design, narrative design, gameplay design and system design.

I've been described as having a wide skill set, good at taking charge of projects and having a contagious optimism that boosts team morale. I've also been described as someone who doesn't shirk away responsibilities.

Other game development related work experience include mentoring game design students. Teachers, students and education managers have all described me as a great asset to have during courses.

All in all, I'm a hard worker and always eager to learn. You can find the projects I've worked on and my responsibilities on them on the Portfolio page. If you wish to contact me, see the Contact page in the header for my e-mail address, telephone number and socials. Thank you for visiting my website!
